Another [helvetic ruby](https://helvetic-ruby.ch) conference after just six month, how lucky we are!

## Generous hallway track

Helvetic ruby 2024 was a single track one day conference. The schedule was mostly like this: half an hour of talk, followed by half an hour of a break. This gave plenty of space to the hallway track. Personally I loved this format and giving that much space to exchange among the attendees.

And while I didn't love the atmosphere of the venue (Technopark Zürich), it was good to have such a big area dedicated to networking and exchange among those Rubyists.

## The talks

[Some very nice talks](https://helvetic-ruby.ch/talks/), my favorites were:

- [Youssef Boulkaid - Ask Your Logs](https://helvetic-ruby.ch/talks/#youssef-boulkaid-ask-your-logs) on how you can improve your logging, by making them structure, enriched and searchable. And then you can answer completely new questions that were quite hard to answer before.
- [Daniel Colson - The Very Hungry Transaction](https://helvetic-ruby.ch/talks/#daniel-colson-the-very-hungry-transaction) on how tricky it can get if you are not careful with your transactions, also the talk was beautifully illustrated and wonderfully paced!

## The range of attendees

I met Andi, who started learning Ruby a month ago with [rubymonstas.ch](https://rubymonstas.ch) and I met a Rails core team member within the same hour. Gotta love this variety of people!

## Additions this year: Open Source Hacking Meetup & Hike

This year the day before the conference they organized an ruby open source hacking meet up. And some people went on a short hike to the Uetliberg the day after. These little additions, organized by the helvetic ruby team, really make a difference, repeat please!

## My own lightning talk on Phlex

[Phlex](https://www.phlex.fun) is a Gem to building HTML fast and elegantly. While it gets some recognition (just passed 1 Million downloads on [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex), I believe it's still not talked about enough. I would have liked to do a full talk on it, but was very unsure whether I would have enough time to not get overwhelmed, with the many things going in my life right now. So I presented a 5-min lightning talk at the conference… which may have been more stressful than a full talk in the end.

I was not sure how to convey the beauty of Phlex in such a short amount of time. Well, that was until the very morning of the conference… when I woke up, I had the inspiration for a better talk than the one I have now given :-) . I even performed that talk in the hallway track one hour before my actual lightning talk when I was asked: "But I don't get Phlex, how is it better than ERB…", I opened VS code and started writing a simple Phlex component and how you can shape it. And getting the response at the after this impromptu talk in front of two people was: "Ah I get it…", what more do you want?

I'll try to record a video of that "alternate lightning talk".

## See you next year!

I definitely want to be part of it again next year in Geneva. [Early bird tickets are available right now](https://ti.to/helvetic-ruby/helvetic-ruby-2025)
