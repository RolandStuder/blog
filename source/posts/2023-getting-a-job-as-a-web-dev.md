# It's easy. It's impossible. Your way to get a job as a self taught web developer

Recently someone posted in a help forum something like:

> I am giving up. While I enjoyed learning JavaScript, I did this online curriculum just before learning about doing APIs with express.js. Now after 200+ applications I did not get any interview.
> Let us be real, people say it's possible, but it's not.

His post made me stop. Is he right? Is the self taught way basically impposible in the current market? I don't think it is. But I do think there are some misundertandings. There is a ton of content out there about how a career as web developer is the path to a cool and high paying job, and that you can learn it all by yourself. Be it by going to one bootcamp, or following one course, one curriculum. It gives an idea of "Follow these easy steps and you get this high paying job. It's easy.""

But the truth is a bit more complicated. Personally I learned programming with The Odin Project, it is a very good broad curriculum, I doubt there is much better stuff out there. In the discord for the community the FAQ / Introduction answer the following question:

> Q: Is TOP hard?
> A: Yes

That is the truth.

Programming is a highly sought skill, and is not easy to master, that is (partially) why coding pays so well. Is it learnable? Absolutely. But it is hard. The idea I can learn a bit of HTML and JavaScript and I can easily a job as a front end developer is
unrealistic. It takes time, patience, deliberate learning, curiosity. People in the discord of the odin project often ask: When am I ready to apply for jobs?" And my response lately has been: "There are no shortcuts, complete the curriculum, the section about getting hired, is at the end of the course for a reason." You can't jump the queue (of course there are exceptions), you can't take shortcuts, you have to learn, and to learn a lot. People send out hundreds of resumes, and yes it's a numbers game, but the numbers change significantly when you
got yourself that solid foundation for programming.

So what should you do to actually get a job? Maybe I am idealistic, but if you solely learn to get a job, it will be tough. It becomes easier when you have an intrinsic motivation to learn programming to deepen your knowledge. I am so surprised when people invest a significant chunk of their time / life into learning programming, but then I find out, that they are not subscribed to any newsletters about programming, they haven't seeked out any online communities (except for the one associated with their course), they are not listening to any podcasts about it, they never went to a local programming meetup. But everyone writes on their CV that they are passionate about programming.

And then by not widening their world, they somehow get the idea they should maybe network, and think cold messaing recruiters on linked in will do anything. It is unlikely a recruiter will help you, junior positions always get a lot of applicants, no recruiters needed for that. Your network begins in a different spot, it begins with the question you ask someone, about the blog post they wrote, with the minute you talked to some senior engineer at a meetup about how you just learned X.

Personally I gave up, it's almost impossible to find anything without connections or pure luck, and you have to work and support yourself while looking. Learning JS was very fun, but there's no way anyone could find a job now with just what TOP offers
Just checked and the new success stories are posted by engineers or even CS graduates, if you are not connected to STEM, there's no way

I did have it reviewed and I (temporarily?) quit studying just before learning about APIs in the Express portion. I sent about 200 CVs, which is not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but I was just too tired of the project grind. No matter what project you have, they're too weak and you need to make more. I don't want to work at Microsoft, I'd be okay anywhere where I'd feel comfortable and respected, and I just don't feel like I should continue grinding and thinking about projects with my chances being low anyway (my personal circumstances complicate this greatly). It was all taking way too long. I guess it's kind of like the stock market - you hear about the ones that made it, but not the ones that fill cemeteries

my discord post:

Hey KZ.

Your post triggered a lot of emotions for me. I think it's great that you bring up this question. "Is it impossible?"

But I want to touch a few things:
it's almost impossible to find anything without connections or pure luck, and you have to work and support yourself while looking

I do think, that the abundance of material online, which has a lot of survivor bias is create an impression that it's kinda easy or at least straightforward  to get a job as a web dev.

Actually the TOP FAQ, states it well:

Is TOP hard?

Very, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. Learning programming in general is tough, no matter where you go. In order to get through it, you'll need to develop grit

All this content kinda creates an impression that it is easy, but people learn programming / coding / computer science for years at university or in apprenticeship, so yes, that is who you compete with for jobs, at the same time the fact that you see so many computer science graduates actually learning with TOP itself shows, that TOP is actually the thing that can prepare you for the job in a way that a degree doesn't necessarily.

Maybe TOP should be harsher in a way to say: "Don't even think about applying before completing the curriculum". The question here is often asked "When can I start to apply?" And I think the answer should be "When you are done with the curriculum". The getting hired section is at the end for a reason. Yes some people get hired before that, but it is a numbers game, and you need to increase your chances.

So when you state you have stopped before doing API with Express, yes you are kinda close the the end of the Javascript path, but on the other hand, you kinda only scratched the surface of what it means to create a professional project.

You need a good project, you need that final project.
Learning JS was very fun

That is great! Love to hear that! Why don't you build on that? And what made you say "The project grind", your job will be the project grind in a way ðŸ™‚ 

Build on what you enjoy. And if you can't find motivation, then build something you like? Something real, something for you!
Let your curiosity lead you.

What have you explored? I am often surprised when I hear that people for for months or years on TOP, but then they didn't expand, did you go to any meetups, did you subsribe to newsletters, blogs, are you listening to podcasts? You say it's impossible without a network, did you create possibilities to start a network? Somehow people seem to think, they need to cold message recruiters, terrible strategy, junior positions get a lot of applications anyway, they dont need recruiters. But have you talked to any engineers, at a meetup, have you emails a genuine question to someone about a blogpost or a talk they gave, have you looked for mentorship programs?


I sent about 200 CVs

If you look at this channel, 200 applications are not that many. It is a numbers game, unless you find your niche, your hook. But if you treat it as a numbers game, so will the company. If you do 200 low effort applications with no customization then this number doesn't count for much.

And as we established, you really need that last project.

I think my comments sound kinda tough. But my point is, it is possible, but no, it's not easy, and not finishing the curriculum to me sounds like you want a short cut. 

I encourage you, to follow the things you liked, that you enjoyed, and build on that, but not alone in front of the computer, but by seeking out other people who share this interest.

Connections will always make it easier, but really, it can be as simple going to a talk, often devs will mention that they are hiring. And then you go say hi, and ask, if they hire juniors, or better ask them for a tips, what he would recommend to you, to find a cool job, like at a company like theirs. Just talk with people, they might give you their email, you write them the next day, they will forward your CV, and it will go to the top of the stack and get a bit more attention than the 100 other application, just because you talked to them for 5 minutes.

Sometime people say on twitter when they say they are hiring to contact them with questions, you'd be surprised how few people ever take that offer, and how much of a headstart this will give you, to get an interview.

Get out there, connect, enjoy, follow your curiosity. Don't think, I have learned enough, you never will have learned enough ðŸ™‚ The more I learn, the more I see my gaps.

You can do it! It's easy? No. It's impossible? No. It's a journey and you have only just begun.
