Have you ever wondered, what one should do with all these big tables in a responsive design?

Zurb shows a nice way, how to handle it and built the solution right into their foundation framework ([http://foundation.zurb.com/)](http://foundation.zurb.com/)). Just make the table scrollable horizontally, while fixing a part of the table:

You can find an example under [http://zurb.com/playground/responsive-tables.](http://zurb.com/playground/responsive-tables.</p)

I like the solution, but it lacks affordance. The table needs to show it is scrollable. btw: this pattern is not new, you can fix columns or rows in Excel and Apple's Numbers does it by default, but appliying it to websites is a cool idea.
