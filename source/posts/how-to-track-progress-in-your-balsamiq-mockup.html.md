When we started to use MyBalsamiq.com more and more, we ran into the problem, that developpers could access our sketches, but they never could be sure, wheter our sketches had been approved by the product owner or not.  
  
We solved this prolem very simply. We created a little symbol library with labels. The labels indicate visually if the sketch is a draft, if it should reviewed by the product owner, or if the the mockup is approved.

So every time a status changes, we just delete the old label and add ad a new one. On the overview Screen of MyBalsamiq you can immediately see, what mockups are approved and which ones need reviewing.
