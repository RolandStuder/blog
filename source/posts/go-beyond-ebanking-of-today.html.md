I always thought today's e-banking applications are not even close to their potential, they are often filled with badly designed forms, the important functionality is spread over a lot of pages and they don't really support you handling your money.  
  
I was really happy to see UBS was looking for new ideas and asking the attendees of [web monday](http://www.amazee.com/web-monday-zurich) to submit ideas to an idea competition. So I briefly sketched out how I thought e-banking should work today.

I think an e-banking application should make the most common tasks, dead simple. For example you shouldn't have to remember any account details for any account you already once transferred money to, an e-banking application should should help you make sense of the transactions that are happening, not just display tables with randomly sorted transactions. And even better an e-banking application could help you set saving goals and it could easily support you in putting together a budget.  
  
The PDF shows my contest entry for the idea competition, I like the ideas, but thinking about it some more, and also after hearing [Pascals](http://ui-logic.ch/) feedback I realize I should have focused and skechted the really new parts in more detail, especially budgeting.  
  
Any feedback on the ideas are higly appreciated, thx to [Chris](http://hymnos.existenz.ch/) and [Pascal](http://ui-logic.ch/) for your quick feedbacks on my contest entry.
