I don't have any original takes on AI. But I struggle with some of it: It makes me lazy, it changes my relationsship to the code.
It makes me lazy.

When doing something, it is so inviting to ask AI to do it and see what it comes up with. To make it the feature just work and defer scrutinizing the approach. I know, I don't have to use AI this way, but I often end up using it that way and then dreading the very necessary big review of the code.

And it scares me a bit, that I loose my skills, my fundamentals. I don't really proceed, learn as much, possibly, maybe? On the other hand, I am learning how to wield this tool, this AI.
