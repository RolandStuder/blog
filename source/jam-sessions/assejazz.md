# ASSEJAZZ Jam Sessions

**Confidence Level:** High - multiple sources confirm this information

ASSEJAZZ (Asociación Sevillana de Jazz) runs weekly jam sessions every Sunday at 1:00 PM at Platea-Odeon-La Imperdible in the old Plaza de Armas train station. These are described as "very open informal spaces" where vocalists and instrumentalists share music interpreting jazz standards and jazz songs.

The venue has a capacity of 200 people with chairs, tables, and stools. Entry is free until maximum capacity is reached.

**How it works:** Drop-in format - bring your instrument or just come to listen. Musicians share jazz standards and jazz songs in an informal setting.

**Organization:** Run by the Seville Jazz Association, which also organizes the Jazz&Clubs Cycle (October-June at Turina Space) and Jazz in CAAC (July-August outdoor concerts).
