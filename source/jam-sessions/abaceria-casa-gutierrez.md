# Abaceria Casa Gutierrez Bi-weekly Jazz Jam

**Confidence Level:** High - specifically mentioned in jazz guides

Abaceria Casa Gutierrez, a small tapas venue located toward the rear of the Feria Market, is the scene of a "fantastic bi-weekly jazz jam" every other Tuesday night at 9:00 PM.

**Schedule:** Every other Tuesday (bi-weekly) at 9:00 PM - not every Tuesday, but alternating weeks.

**Setting:** Traditional abacería (small grocery shop combined with bar) where you can sample products on the premises. Authentic Sevillian atmosphere.

**Location:** Situated on Calle Amargura, near the Palacio de los Marqueses de la Algaba, on the edge of the Mercado de la Feria.

**Specialties:**
- Local wines and homemade tapas
- "Montaito Casa Gutiérrez" made with pork loin and whiskey
- Traditional tapas like migas, tortilla de papas, and papas aliñá

**Atmosphere:** Described as having an authentic Sevillian atmosphere, combining the traditional abacería culture with live music.

**Note:** This is specifically a jazz jam session, not just live music, making it a true participatory venue for musicians.
