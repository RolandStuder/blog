**Confidence Level:** Medium - information from local chat and venue research, but schedule is newly starting

Sala EVEN is starting jam sessions as mentioned in local musician chat from September 2025. The venue mentioned they were having their "second session" on September 18, 2024 (?), indicating this is a new and developing jam series.

**How it works:** There's a list of available songs provided. You need to give advance notice that you're going to attend (contact the organizer), and once there you choose songs you want to play.

**Capacity:** Approximately 300 people with modern aesthetic, spacious dance floor, and multiple VIP rooms. State-of-the-art sound and lighting systems.

**Venue hours:** Thursday to Saturday, concerts 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM, club hours 1:00 AM to 7:00 AM.

**Musical diversity:** The venue hosts concerts for all musical styles, from rock and pop to the most avant-garde and alternative proposals, including tributes. After shows, DJ sets cover experimental electronic music to commercial sound.

**Organization contact:** Instagram @adriansfdez - described as "one of the musicians who runs it" in the local chat.

**Note:** This appears to be a new jam session series, so schedule and format may still be developing.
