**Confidence Level:** High - multiple sources confirm this underground venue

La Bicicleteria is described as "a legend on Seville's underground scene," situated on Calle Feria, "arguably the city's scruffiest, most bohemian street."

**Schedule:** Every Tuesday, usually about 11:00 PM, La Bicicleteria stages live performances by local musicians. Additionally, the venue "usually has live jazz at least once weekly."

**Entry:** Entry is by knocking on a door that looks more like it leads into an abandoned building than somewhere you'd go to hear music.

**Setting:** Tiny and wonderfully odd drinking den with a bohemian atmosphere. Musicians are "improbably wedged in amongst the decorative clutter and their audience."

**Practical info:**
- Payment: Cash only
- Pet-friendly: Dogs allowed
- Accessible parking available
- Compact, intimate space - recommended to arrive early

**Atmosphere:** Described as having "bohemian vibes" that "provide a unique ambiance" despite the small size. Part of Seville's vibrant underground music scene.

**Location note:** Located in the Feria neighborhood, known as one of the most bohemian areas of Seville.
