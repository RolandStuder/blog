**Confidence Level:** High - multiple sources and official website confirm

Gallo Rojo hosts "Bad Jam" sessions every Friday at 7:30 PM. The venue features several floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the barrio near the Setas and has live music 6 days a week (Thursday is normally for swing dancers with pre-recorded music).

**Musical styles:** Local jazz musicians perform bebop, manouche, and even New Orleans traditional jazz. The musicians that perform seem to know each other well, which adds to the intimate and friendly experience.
